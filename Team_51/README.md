# QEasy - QR-Based Personalized Menu System

## Overview
QEasy is a modern web application that transforms the restaurant dining experience through QR code technology and personalized menu recommendations. The system allows customers to scan a restaurant's QR code to access a customized menu based on their previous orders, time of day, and popular items.

An ordering system that utilizes QR codes and cloud-based online menu to solve inefficiencies in order handling at small kitchens and improve customer experience. The solution introduces features such as real-time menu updates, contactless ordering, AI chatbots, and integrated payment solutions to reduce costs while improving speed and personalization in service. By leveraging web-based technologies, cloud computing services, AI analytics, and secure payment gateways, QEasy creates true scale and efficiency for restaurant ordering systems while tracking customer preferences to provide personalized recommendations based on past order histories and searches.
